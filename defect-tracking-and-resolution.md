# Defect Control and Rectification

Defect Control and Rectification involves:

* Recording defects
* Rectification of defects
* Identifying recurring defects
* Defect rectification deferral
* Use of the MEL \(if applicable\)
* Securing or deactivating unserviceable equipment
* Notification to the pilot of the aircraft status

These activities are covered by  STD 726.08 \(1\)\(o\).

## Recording Defects

Recording of a defect in the software is performed through the Defect Maintenance window.

TODO - add details.

## Rectification of Defects

Adding defects to work orders.

Recording work order results as rectifications.

## Identifying Recurring Defects

Accordint to CARs 726.05 _Defect Recording and Control_

1. Pursuant to section 706.05 of the CARs, the defect recording system has to include a method to highlight defects that recur, so that they are readily identifiable by flight crews and the maintenance organization at all bases where the aircraft is operated. The air operator is responsible for identifying defects as recurring defects to maintenance personnel in order to avoid the duplication of unsuccessful attempts at rectification.

2. Pursuant to section 706.05 of the CARs, the defect control system has to ensure that the rectification of a defect identified as a recurring defect will take into account the methodology used in previous repair attempts.  
    \(amended 2008/12/30\)

3. For the purposes of these standards, defects are recurring defects if a failure mode is repeated three times, on a particular aircraft, within 15 flight segments of a previous repair made in respect of that failure mode.  
    \(amended 2008/12/30\)

In the FTU Aircraft Maintenance software, the method to identify the recurring maintenance activities is to associate each defect report with a code that identifies the component or system that was "the cause" of the defect or issue.  If defects using the same code occure within the time period identified in the requirements, it is flagged as a recurring defect.

The codes used are taken from the Transport Canada Joint Aircraft System Codes \(JASC\) published in 2008.  These are in alighnment with the FAA ATA100 classification system.

### Selecting a JASC code to apply to a Defect

The JASC code can be selected and applied at the time the defect is entered or later, when more information is available about the cause of the defect report.

The code can be entered directly or a heading entry can be selected that will reduce the JASC code list down to a managable size.

TODO - pictures.
