# Aircraft Maintenance Tracking

A manual for the Aircraft Maintenance Tracking feature of the mckayERP Flight Training Unit software.

This manual is intended for users of the FTU software who are involved with the regulatory activities surrounding aircraft maintenance.  While designed for a flight school, the maintenance features of the software could be applied to flight operations of all sizes.

The software provides tools for the Person Responsible for Maintenance \(PRM\) that assist in the tracking of the miriad requirements on preventative maintenance for aircraft and their components.  Built on top of a full ERP system, the software includes a complete logistics system that can be configured to manage a world-wide operation but can also easily manage a small Aircraft Maintenance Organization.

One goal of the software is to eliminate the need for external tools and spreadsheets.  All the data required for the maintenance and verification of the requirements is maintained within the application.  External applications and the effort required to maintain them should not be required.

The FTU Maintenance Software is intended for Canadian Flight Operators that operate under the Canadian Aviation Regulations.  The software can be exteded and customized to comply with other foreign regulations as required.  Under the CARs, the maintenance activities involve:

* tracking flight operations;
* managing the maintenance schedules for periodic and non-periodic inspections and overhauls;
* ensuring compliance with Airworthiness Directives and other special instructions;
* personnel training requirements and tracking;
* managing snags and defects discovered during operations or maintenance activities;
* providing a means to create maintenance work orders based on the maintenance requirements and close the work orders when the work has been completed;
* track components through their entire life-cycle from the aircraft \(the main assembly\) down to the smallest component of interest;
* keep component history across installation, removal and overhaul; and
* supporting the technical dispatch of the aircraft after maintenance activities are completed.

The software will provide alerts when maintenance or training requirements are coming due.  These alerts will provide timely notice to those responsible so that appropriate maintenance actions can be taken to ensure continued compliance.  

The software also provides reports and dashboards to show the state of the fleet and the schedule of upcoming maintenance activities.  Using this information, the PRM can plan the maintenance activities in an effective manner.
